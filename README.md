# CS-210-MODULE-EIGHT-ASSIGNMENT



    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
    The project is to produce a list of all items that were purchesed in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased. It solved that by outputing as such into a text file.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    I integrated Python and C++ together to make this project happen. I believe that I was able to successfully produce a working build with it as well.
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    
    I feel as though I went a little overboard writing the comments in here. I should improve it by only writing the comments in the most necessary portions in the project.
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    The python commands were definitely the most challenging part. I say this because in grocer.cpp, I had to remember which Python command did what. Thankfully I reflected on the starter code that I had and I went from there.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    
    Python integration, as well as while loops and outputing files may be particularly transferable to other projects.
   
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    This program was maintainable because I properly used the commands that I needed to complete it. As well as using comments, it helped with making sure that the code was readable as well as adaptable.
